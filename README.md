To start a game, just press START (SIMPLE RIGHT!)
Move the pieces by grabbing them and dropping them at legal positions. Legal positions are highlighted in red squares.
to replay your game, press the replay button after your game and then control every move with A and D. (A to move backwards and D to move Forwards)

(TODO!)
1. Add a result screen that comes up when a side checkmates.
2. Tweek the replay system to be able to replay multiple games.
3. fix some errors.
